This repo is the public construction of NISD Groups, a project I started in late 2016. 

It is a PhoneGap mobile application used for managing databases of phone and other contact records of administrators in the Northwest Independent School District in Justin, TX.

This project will eventually be based on jQuery Mobile with a semi-custom theme that I developed with the provided API for doing-so.
